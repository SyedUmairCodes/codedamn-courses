# Hypertext Transfer Protocol

Hypertext transfer protocol or HTTP is the protocol used by web browsers to send or accept requests. Their are certain rules that both the server 
and the computer have to follow for a request to be successful. HTTP is a plain-text protocol so the requests that we make and the respone that we 
get from the server are in a human readiable format most of the times in JSON.

> Servers and clients can also communicate in a binary based protocol as well.

In order to see exactly what information is sent and recieved in HTTP requests you can use the networks tab of your web broweser(Chrome) or use an 
API client like Postman to see all the information for each request that your computer makes.

HTTP requests are made up of two parts, a header and a body. The header contains a bunch of different things while the body contains the actual 
request that the user is making and it's mostly written in JSON.
